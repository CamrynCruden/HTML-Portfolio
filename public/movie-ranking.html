        <h3>The Imoposible</h3>
        <p>This heart-wrenching story based on true events never fails to bring tears to my eyes. A family on holiday get caught in a tsunami and after many challenges and near death experiences they defy all odds, find eachother and go home.</p></li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Martian</h3>
        <p>My affinity for space and thriller movies made this reasonably realistic movie stand out. An astrnaut has to survive alone on Mars after being left behind by his team. Both the abandoned astronaut and NASA exhaust all options for survival until he can be rescued.</p>

        <h3>Norbit</h3>
        <p>This outrageous comedy has been a personal favourite of mine for years. Movie gives a similar feel to "GrownUps".</p>
